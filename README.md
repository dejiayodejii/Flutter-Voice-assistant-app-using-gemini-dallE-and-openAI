# Flutter voice assistant app

The application allows users to engage in conversations with a chat assistant by providing audio input, which is then processed using speech recognition and transformed into text. The generated text is fed into the openAI/Gemini model for natural language understanding, and the assistantâ€™s responses are conveyed to the user in audio format.
